What would you do if you wanted to look at something really small?
Maybe you'd pull out your trusty magifying glass.

But what if the thing was too small, or maybe you wanted to look at it with even finer detail.

Well, then - i propose - you should use an electron microscope



An electron microscope is a microscope that uses electrons instead of light
In its simplest form it consists of three main parts, the electron gun, the lens system and the sample - the thing you want to look at.

The electron gun shoots electrons at the sample.

The lenses focus the electrons to the spot where we want them. They are also used to scan the electron beam over the sample.

When the electrons hit the sample they are either absorbed or reflected. While scanning over the sample, the pixel intensity is determined by the amount of electrons reflected.



With this simple principle, electron microscopes can take extremely high quality images of extremely small things
