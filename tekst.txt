What would you do if you wanted to look at something really small?
Something really really small - 
And you wanted to look at it in great detail.

You would probably use one of these - a microscope
But what if you wanted to go even smaller than what the photons could discern?

Well, then - i say - you should use an electron microscope
Hold up, what is that

An electron microscope is simply a microscope that uses electrons (fake end of video)

In its simplest form it consists of three main parts, the electron gun, the lens system and the sample holder - which is the thing we want to look at.

The electron gun shoots electrons in the direction of the sample.

The lens system focuses the electrons to the spot where we want them. It can also be used to scan the electron beam over the sample.
